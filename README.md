Hello, I’m Parth Welde 👋 A passionate and self-driven Data Analytics enthusiast who loves solving real-world problems with clean, insightful, and business-ready data solutions. Coming from a non-coding background, I’ve built my skill set through persistent learning, hands-on practice, and a strong focus on clarity and simplicity. I enjoy diving deep into datasets to extract meaningful insights, build intuitive dashboards, and develop machine learning models that are not just technically sound, but easy to understand and explain — especially in interviews and business settings.

🔍 I’m currently pursuing Data Science, with a growing portfolio of projects that reflect my structured approach and attention to detail. I’m proficient in **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** for data preprocessing, **Power BI** for dynamic and interactive dashboards, **SQL** for structured querying and data manipulation, and **DAX** for advanced calculations. I also work continuously on improving my communication skills so I can confidently explain insights, KPIs, and model results in a way that resonates with both technical and non-technical audiences.

📊 Some of my key projects include a **Power BI dashboard for EV Charging Station analysis**, designed to provide actionable business insights through carefully crafted visuals, custom KPIs, slicers, and location-based grouping. I’ve also developed a **Smart Route Suggestion ML System** using Random Forest to predict accident severity — this project follows a complete pipeline including data cleaning, EDA, model training, evaluation, and clear presentation of insights. Another practical project I’ve worked on is a **Traffic Accident Analysis using SQL**, where I extracted valuable trends and visual summaries from structured data using advanced SQL queries. Additionally, I created a **Custom QR Code Generator** using Python — combining automation, branding, and customization to generate visually distinct QR codes for various use cases.

🚀 My goal is to grow into a confident **Data Analyst or Data Scientist** who can blend technical accuracy with business storytelling. I’m particularly focused on building analytics solutions that are **practical, presentation-ready**, and aligned with industry needs. I'm also working toward mastering **advanced ML techniques** and contributing to **open-source or team-based data projects** where collaboration and creativity matter.

📧 You can connect with me on **LinkedIn** at [linkedin.com/in/parth-welde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-welde) or reach me via email at \[parthaissmscoe@gmail.com]. I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, and opportunities that allow me to apply my data skills to meaningful, real-world challenges.
